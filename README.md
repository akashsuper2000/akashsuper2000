<h1> Hi, I'm Akash 👋 </h1>

I am Akash, a graduate student at Stony Brook University in New York, pursuing a Master's in Computer Science. I come from a background in software development, having previously worked as an SDE at Amazon. Before pursuing my graduate studies, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Amrita School of Engineering.

I aim to become the best software engineer, and to pursue research in the fields of NLP, Computer Vision, and Robotics.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am a serial hobbyist and enjoy exploring new ideas in the fields of philosophy and science. I am also an avid hiker and like to explore different adventure sports.
